This is the intended, normal way to consume them.\\n* **Figurative Meaning:** The samosa feels \"used\" in a relationship sense. It feels like it\\'s only valued for its utility (being dipped in chutney) and not for its own sake.\\n* **\"Dipped on\"** is a pun. It refers to:\\n    * **The literal act of dipping:** The samosa is constantly being dipped in chutney.\\n    * **Being taken advantage of:** \"Dipped on\" can also mean being taken advantage of or treated poorly in a relationship.\\n\\nTherefore, the joke is funny because it anthropomorphizes the samosa, giving it human-like feelings of being used and unappreciated in its \"relationship\" with the chutney. The pun on \"dipped on\" adds to the humor by connecting the literal act of eating with the figurative feeling of being exploited.'}"
